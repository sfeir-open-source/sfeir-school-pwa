# Minimal Entrypoint

<p class="center">
Should it include the main navigation UI?
</p>

Notes:
left: application shell is in html -> heavy entry point
right: application shell in PeopleApp -> light entry point = better first paint and T.T.I.

The App Entrypoint should have minimal static dependencies, in other words, not much beyond the app-shell itself.

# Shell

<p class="center">
include everything needed for first paint
</p>
